It was fun solving a problem for someone I know because it felt like my coding had a real purpose. 
This project showed me a glimpse of what coders in the real world may do for someone. 
Equations are ways that people solve problems for customers and those looking for an answer but do not know how to generate it themselves.
 I was so happy to help my mother with the percentage of her income she spends on groceries. 
 It really felt like my code and taking this course had purpose in life. 
 Programming by myself instead of with a partner was definitely different and slightly more 
 difficult because I had to figure some problems out on my own.
  I did not have someone reading me the directions as 
  I was writing code or pointing out any issues I had with my algorithm before submitting the design. 
  I learned I must stay patient, try several times by myself to solve the issue first and then get help from the professor or another classmate if I still could not figure out the issue. Next time I would double check my algorthim before submitting it so I don't have to resubmit my design multiple times. I also think I should also try to code my algorithm earlier in the week so then I know if it works or not before the due date rather then scrambling to code it in the lab the night before. Overall I really enjoyed this project and it made me feel like I was a pro coder because it was so fun!
